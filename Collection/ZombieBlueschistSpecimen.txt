Zombie Blueschist Specimen

AD: XXXX

A Zombie Blueschist specimen in a Petri dish. Below is an excerpt from an Enders researcher's log:  "Blueschist, dull blue in color. Does Blueschist have a lifespan? Blueschist generally turns to dust and returns to the earth when it does not transform into an Ender or an AO Crystal... but in rare cases they can become almost zombified, if you will. When this happens, it loses most of its functionality and slowly migrates en masse, thus forming regions like the Lazulum Belt."
