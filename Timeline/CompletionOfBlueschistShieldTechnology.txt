Completion of Blueschist Shield Technology

AD: [Manual Entry]

The AO Waves emitted by AO Crystals could pass through almost all matter and would attract Enders, meaning research into shutting AO Waves out had always been a priority. It was during this year that reflective optical paint was finally developed, capable of deflecting 99.997% of AO Waves once hardened. This made interior storage of AO far easier, while also allowing for the installation of AO engines in Cradles.
