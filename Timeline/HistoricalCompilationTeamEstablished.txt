Historical compilation team established

AD: [Manual Entry]

Ten years after the collapse of Amasia The former citizens of Old Amasia have completed their relocation to the surface. Those who were settled into their Nests were provided with the opportunity to reflect upon the past. At the behest of the Amasian Nest Organization, the "Historical Compilation Society" initiative was founded. The society's stated mission was to collect what little remained after Amasia's collapseCCTV footage, documents, etc.so that the historical legacy of Amasia would not be buried under the rubble as well. Every creed of Drifter, no matter their spotted past or criminal record, was welcome to join the effort, and their efforts were well compensated. Any recovered material was collected and organized at the headquarters for the Historical Compilation Society, and thorough analyses were conducted in order to shed light upon long-lost truths.
