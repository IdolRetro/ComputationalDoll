First Magus lot completed

AD: [Manual Entry]

An initial lot of two Magus were completed and sent into trial operation. Development also finished on the CRADLECOFFINs, and pilot training commenced between man and machine human and Magus. Two Magus and two CRADLECOFFINs were created in this lot. The Magus themselves demonstrated humanlike emotions far beyond those observed in the prototype, and garnered high expectations as the future friends of humanity. Despite very brief contact with individuals outside of combat training, they were able to deepen engagement with several humans. Even so, such output was nothing but the result of quantum calculation. Their quantum computers had undergone compulsory miniaturization in the initial lot, putting a tremendous strain on the Magus bodies that resulted in malfunctions in an extremely short period of time. They were deemed impossible to repair, and stored away for safekeeping.
