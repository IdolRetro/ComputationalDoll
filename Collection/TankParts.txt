Tank Parts

AD: XXXX

Originally belonging to a cutting-edge tank from the end of the 21st century, these parts were used to explore the outside world. Driven by a metamaterial battery, solar power generation allowed them to transport resources for human consumption for comparatively long periods of operation. People would head to the surface in slipshod combinations of tanks and agricultural equipment. These machines would later evolve into the Cradle exoskeletons, allowing people to perform their work from the driver's seat.
