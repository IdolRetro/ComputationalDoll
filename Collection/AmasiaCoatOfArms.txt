Amasia Coat of Arms

AD: XXXX

A metal badge featuring the Amasia Coat of Arms, created for the Amasia Construction Declaration Ceremony. The reverse triangle motif is thought to be a reference to the mineshaft that was the site for the construction work, or perhaps an upside-down letter "A"â€”with the poor information management prior to Amasia's completion, the truth of the design is lost to history. The V verification panel on the neck of the Magus is designed with respect to the Coat of Arms.
