Mass production of general- purpose Magus

AD: [Manual Entry]

Some new surface bases proceeded to industrialize, and succeeded in the mass production of general-purpose Magus. The human-like elements that manifested in prior Magus models such as psychological singularitywere not prioritized; instead, internal and external durability were emphasized, in order to reduce the need for maintenance. This turned them into beings far removed from humans, in both mind and body. As a result, there was deep-seated criticism of the general-purpose Magus, since they lacked the friends of humanity" aspect present in the first several Magus lots. Even so, some extolled their virtues as the perfect partners, specifically due to this disparity from humans. The matter is still up for debate to this very day.
