Raintight serum completed

AD: [Manual Entry]

After the collapse of Amasia, the Raintight serum was created by a medical research team led by Dr. Dothan Kuze and then distributed by the government. Wide-scale production began immediately in a former Amasian research facility on the surface. Administration of the serum began at several sites, and people lined up in droves at each location in the hopes of getting an early dose. Moreover, the personal data of the gene's provider is still completely unknown.
