Evacuation to underground facilities begins

AD: [Manual Entry]

Miraculously avoiding the floods after the Tears of the New Moon, as well as the resulting Mosaic Disease, survivors slowly began to gather at facilities in each region. Most of these facilities had limited resources, however, and the resulting scramble for food led to a number of tragic incidents. At the same time, a lucky few groups managed to arrive at operable vegetation production plants, allowing them to become self- sufficient.
