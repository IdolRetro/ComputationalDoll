Blueschist Polluted Skeleton

AD: XXXX

The Blueschist found within the blue rains has a heavy toll on the environment. It has no effect on flora and fauna, apart from changing foliage coloring, but if humans come into contact with it, they develop what's known as Mosaic Disease. Blueschist clings to the skin, and within a short period of time, it can invade muscle and nerve tissue, causing fatal disorders within the human body. This is a sample specimen where the Blueschist has made it all the way to the bone.
