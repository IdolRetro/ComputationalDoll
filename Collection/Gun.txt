Gun

AD: XXXX

A gun, likely of Amasian make. Presumed stolen as the Amasia Coat of Arms, a requirement on all standard-issue firearms, is nowhere to be found. There is a possibility that it was used by the Anti-Amasia Organization. The smuggling of Amasian wares to the surface has been a long-standing issue since Amasia's founding.
