<div class='text'>Amasia collapses</div>
<div class='text'>AD: [Manual Entry]</div>
<div class='text'>123 years after the Tears of the New Moon, Blueschist Density suddenly and unexpectedly spiked in the lowest level of Amasia. The Great Shield collapsed immediately afterward, along with the foundations of Amasia itself. In the pandemonium that followed, many people were swallowed up by something consisting of Blueschist, and less than half of the population were able to escape. This collapse nearly wiped out the heads of the Amasian government, making subsequent relief efforts and further investigation into the cause of this phenomenon difficult to execute.</div>

<div class='text'>The people realized during this period that, for one reason or another, the blue rain would only affect humans. Animals and vegetation continued to thrive under the rain, in regions now devoid of human life. One day, humans foraging in the early afternoon came under assault by a gigantic creature. Fleeing in fear, one forager recalled its appearance clearly: the sharp fangs, rending claws and bluish-black body. This would come to be Known as an Ender"one that ended the world, whose existence heralded Armageddon itself. And thus, the surface world was no longer safe in any weather.</div>

<div class='text'>Finally, after losing many lives in the process, humanity eventually succeeded in repelling a small Ender. Enders cores were discovered to be weak points, allowing the development of Cradles with weapons effective against them. Ender-related damage and injuries dropped significantly, and the scope of exploration expanded further into the outside world. This would lead to encounters with even more powerful Enders; nevertheless, it was an important step for humanity.</div>

<div class='text'>Once the Enders dwelling in the vertical shaft were defeated and construction on the Great Shield had started, the governmental policy for the period after establishment of the city was announced. While it expressed hope for the development of the city and humanity, it also announced a strict set of guidelines for becoming a resident, leading a minority of those on the surface who had been friendly toward the project to now turn against it. Certain items were objected to most strongly: Management of the population with birth control and the Terminal Union Obligation to suppress emotions using E-Supplements Division of living area based on profession Most of those who turned against the administration departed the plan and returned to their original settlements, but this also served to intensify the labor movement while radicalizing a small segment of the rebels, turning them into guerillas. This can be considered one of the primary factors in the delay of the construction of Amasia.</div>

<div class='text'>Even in evacuation zones and places blessed with rainfall, stores of water and food were scarce. Only scant amounts of spring water were drinkable, as consuming the rain itself was totally out of the question. Despite fear of the blue rain, people were compelled to venture into the outside world for sustenance. As far as they could see from indoors, the blue rain that had been lethal to humans seemed to have no effect on the flora and fauna. Without a weather forecast system, groups would manufacture hermetically-sealed wheeled vehicles from the relative safety of the shelters, in the hopes of protecting themselves from the rapidly increasing spells of heavy rainfall.</div>

The Magus themselves demonstrated humanlike emotions far beyond those observed in the prototype, and garnered high expectations as the future friends of humanity. Despite very brief contact with individuals outside of combat training, they were able to deepen engagement with several humans. Even so, such output was nothing but the result of quantum calculation. Their quantum computers had undergone compulsory miniaturization in the initial lot, putting a tremendous strain on the Magus bodies that resulted in malfunctions in an extremely short period of time. They were deemed impossible to repair, and stored away for safekeeping.</div>

The society's stated mission was to collect what little remained after Amasia's collapseCCTV footage, documents, etc.so that the historical legacy of Amasia would not be buried under the rubble as well. Every creed of Drifter, no matter their spotted past or criminal record, was welcome to join the effort, and their efforts were well compensated.

The human-like elements that manifested in prior Magus models such as psychological singularitywere not prioritized; instead, internal and external durability were emphasized, in order to reduce the need for maintenance. This turned them into beings far removed from humans, in both mind and body. As a result, there was deep-seated criticism of the general-purpose Magus, since they lacked the friends of humanity" aspect present in the first several Magus lots. Even so, some extolled their virtues as the perfect partners, specifically due to this disparity from humans. The matter is still up for debate to this very day.</div>

<div class='text'>. Drifters often reported seeing Enders in close proximity to AO Crystals, and it was determined that the Enders absorb some kind of energy from the crystals. This discovery launched research projects aiming to harness that energy. A few years later, the technology was created to turn these AO Waves emitted by the crystals into electrical energy. This led to a full- scale operation to harvest as many AO Crystals as possible, as a new source of energy. This in turn had the effect of preventing massive AO Crystals from forming, and of preventing the formation of the Giga Structures that form around them.</div>

The one recovered here is made of metal and around twenty centimeters tall, but many types were made, from life-size down to figures two centimeters tall. The pedestal has a cover which, when removed, reveals a hollow inside the bust. Inside was a memo written on paper, an incredibly valuable commodity in Amasia. It must have been inserted by the bust's previous Owner, presumably an upper-class citizen. The memo reads:  "The facade: a stern smile. What could be lying underneath?"</div>

<div class='text'>In order to collect AO crystals while dodging the threat of Enders, the Drifters needed a way to rapidly mine AO Crystals. The excavator was devised for this purpose. This is the initial prototype of the excavator during its development phase. Over time, the output was increased and the form factor reduced until a two-in-one model with an integrated arm manipulator was ultimately adopted.</div>

The part exposed to the outside—that is, the part seen by the contract holder— represents the pinnacle of Amasia biotechnology, creating an eye indistinguishable from that of a human—apart from, perhaps, being even more beautiful. The interior is packed with all forms of sensors, allowing for the transmission of the kind of high-spec calculations unique to Magus.

Well, we made it did make it fast... but to the point where we thought nobody could even pilot it. When we started up the test runs, all of the Drifters were tripping. But after we worked on the Magus support, Drifters became more accustomed to the speed, and now they're all flitting about with ease. I'll miss seeing Drifters fall flat on their face, but if CRADLECOFFINS don't get wrecked from damage from the Enders, that just means less work for us. And less work isn't a bad thing."</div>

In this ritual, End of Lifers and mourners alike will don masks, each with a distinct theme: joy, anger, sorrow, or pleasure. End of Lifers will enter coffins of red and white on their own accord, meeting their final slumber. The mourners then carry the End of Lifers' coffins in a parade-like fashion to their final destination, the city center (the Terminal), while acting out their assigned emotions with intense vigor.

<div class='text'>Terminal Union is a system under which the maximum lifespan for citizens of Amasia has been universally decided upon. Once a month, those who have reached that age are then gathered and painlessly euthanized. However, for those who manage to survive this long, it is extremely unpleasant to then legally be instructed to die, and the system has begun to face heavy opposition from within—and not just from those joining the Anti-Amasia Organization. That said, the age for Terminal Union is still far higher than the average life expectancy of those living on the harsh surface. Once Amasia was completed, distribution of E-Supplements began and the system went into operation, regardless of the various issues</div>
