Watch-Type Personal Terminal

AD: XXXX

A wristwatch-style device created just prior to the formation of the historical compilation team.  All team members were provided with a device on loan and were required to wear one while on duty. Members had to return the device upon leaving the team. When calling for applicants for the historical compilation team, there was an overwhelming response that far exceeded the number of positions available. It would seem many of the former Amasian citizens wanted to know what happened during the collapse.
