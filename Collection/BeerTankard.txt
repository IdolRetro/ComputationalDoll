Beer Tankard

AD: XXXX

A beer tankard with a thick glass, found in a slum in the Lower-Class Ward. Food, clothing, shelter, and other daily necessities were all strictly regulated in Amasia. Bars were illegal, but the Amasian government turned a blind eye to those that Drifters frequented. The government must have believed that Drifters should be given special treatment for their critical services in collecting AO Crystals.
