Early Cradle Part

AD: XXXX

Hand and leg part thought to have been used in early Cradle development. Most Cradle materials were gathered from legacies of the past, but this rare part was produced specifically for use in Cradles. The curved surfaces were forged by a metalwork craftsman, using data computed by a small scientific calculator. The beautiful traces of hammer work speak of the craftsman's precision. One can only imagine how much of the world this Cradle has seenâ€”or how many lives it has saved.
