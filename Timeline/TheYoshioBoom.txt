The Yoshio Boom

AD: [Manual Entry]

> After the educational show Yoshio was unceremoniously cancelled years prior, businesses were left with excess inventory of stuffed toys of the protagonist. Subsequently, the toys were distributed to childrens institutions and slums for free. Worn from the rough handling of children and attempts to patch them up, they were discovered by a designer who turned them into illustrations and posted them on Amasias local online network. Cute despite its unsettling appearance, its unstable character, and its sorrowful air, the new mascot was a particular hit with downtrodden young women and became the subject of unauthorized merchandise.
