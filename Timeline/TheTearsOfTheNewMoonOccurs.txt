The Tears of the New Moon occurs

AD: [Manual Entry]

2099, the evening of a new moon... An intense storm began brewing in a vast area centered around the Mediterranean Sea. Heavy rain also began falling on inland areas that had seen little rain up to that pointincluding the area where Amasia would eventually be built. Over the next two days, the rain continued to spread and churn; the people looked to the skies with unease, shielding their eyes from the downpour. Before long, the rain turned blue, and those who touched this tainted deluge met an ignoble end. The floods spread across the world faster than the warnings could, wiping out 92% of the population in the first week. Most information regarding the final throes of this world has been lost.
