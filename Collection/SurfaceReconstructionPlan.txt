Surface Reconstruction Plan

AD: XXXX

A comprehensive map showing known settlements and abandoned cities that have been raised as potential relocation sites for those who lost their homes in the collapse of Amasia. The map contains everything known to-date about the surface by both the people of Amasia and the people above ground and has information available in the Amasian language as well as other languages on Ender sightings.  It just goes to show how people have been working together ever since the Tears of the New Moon. One could say the map even represents humanity.
