Wooden Bear

AD: XXXX

Surface Transition Plan Report (Part 1): A wood carving of a bear. An audio recording device was recovered from inside the salmon. While the mastermind of the Surface Transition Plan was carefully concealed, various corroborative evidence points to President Morado as the one who took charge from the outset. Below is a transcription of restored audio, containing the voice of a surface citizen:  "Strange containers are popping up everywhere. We tried to open one, but none of our Cradles could even make a dent. | wonder if they're some sort of secret Amasian technology or something. I'll bet you there's treasure inside!"
