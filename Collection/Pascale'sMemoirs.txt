Pascale's Memoirs

AD: XXXX

Project Pascale, as derived from the Magus Project. This memoir is believed to have been written by Pascale herself. It utilizes her distinctive cursive and mirror writing, and while the contents are merely personal musings rather than anything confidential, they are still yet to be deciphered.  "| always thought | wanted to strut about on the surface on my own, but ever since Mystere was born, nothing has brought me more joy than to think of the journeys we'll have together. | just know | can go further and faster than | can alone with a companion by my side."
