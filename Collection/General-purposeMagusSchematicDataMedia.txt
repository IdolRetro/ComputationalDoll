General-Purpose Magus Schematic Data Media

AD: XXXX

Original Amasian data containing general-purpose Magus schematics. Uses AO Wave reading technology. General- purpose Magus have self-repair sequences quite superior to even the high-performance Amasian Magus, which allows them to operate with limited maintenance. After the collapse of Amasia, the interim government released this data to aid in the reconstruction of the area, which led many researchers to begin developing general-purpose Magus.
