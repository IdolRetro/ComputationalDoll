Chopsticks

AD: XXXX

Chopsticks are implements for eating involving the use of two sticks that taper down toward one end. They are coated with a lacquer derived from plant resin, allowing for long-term use. It is presumed that the thicker end was held using a grip similar to that of holding a pen, and then the two tips were pinched together to collect food and carry it to the mouth. There were also apparently longer versions used primarily in the preparation of food, with mention made of them in the sushi and sukiyaki recipes carried back from the east by long- distance expeditions.
