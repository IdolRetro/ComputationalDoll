Ernesto Election Statue

AD: XXXX

A bust of President Ernesto.  The one recovered here is made of metal and around twenty centimeters tall, but many types were made, from life-size down to figures two centimeters tall. The pedestal has a cover which, when removed, reveals a hollow inside the bust. Inside was a memo written on paper, an incredibly valuable commodity in Amasia. It must have been inserted by the bust's previous Owner, presumably an upper-class citizen. The memo reads:  "The facade: a stern smile. What could be lying underneath?"
