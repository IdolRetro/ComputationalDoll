Metal Supplement Case

AD: XXXX

A metal case designed to carry E-â€œSupplements. The surface has been powerfully punched with the lettering "Only one tablet per day!" The interior is divided into two compartments, likely to carry different types of supplement. Supplements are prescribed to each citizen individually by the medical Al, but as they are easy to manufacture, the citizens have been known to trade them at will, as well as using them as currency for various illegal dealings.
