AO Engine Prototype

AD: XXXX

A prototype model of an AO engine, the power source for Cradles and CRADLECOFFINs. The cracked and charred parts suggest it overheated and explodedâ€”or was perhaps detonated intentionally for testing purposes. AO engines liquefy AO Crystals to extract energy from the crystal lattices, differentiating them from Enders who absorb their AO waves instead. Although this prototype demonstrates the technological limitations present 13 years after the world's collapse, the basic design has remained the same for several centuries. The AO engine allows for direct processing of AO Crystals, and thus is employed as a universal power source.
