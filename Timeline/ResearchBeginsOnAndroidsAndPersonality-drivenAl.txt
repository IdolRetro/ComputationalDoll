Research begins on androids and personality-driven Al

AD: [Manual Entry]

Five years since the founding of the city, and the citizens of Amasia Were overflowing with creativity, even developing products and technology that didn't exist at the end of the 21st century. Or maybe they were just lonely. This was the period when work began on autonomous androids, intended for such purposes as cleaning and cooking. The Al used internally in these androids and the organic materials used for their exterior appearance rapidly came to mimic humans, almost as though seeking to create the friends of humanity."
