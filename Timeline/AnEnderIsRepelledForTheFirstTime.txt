An Ender is repelled for the first time

AD: [Manual Entry]

Finally, after losing many lives in the process, humanity eventually succeeded in repelling a small Ender. Enders cores were discovered to be weak points, allowing the development of Cradles with weapons effective against them. Ender-related damage and injuries dropped significantly, and the scope of exploration expanded further into the outside world. This would lead to encounters with even more powerful Enders; nevertheless, it was an important step for humanity.
