Amasia collapses

AD: [Manual Entry]

123 years after the Tears of the New Moon, Blueschist Density suddenly and unexpectedly spiked in the lowest level of Amasia. The Great Shield collapsed immediately afterward, along with the foundations of Amasia itself. In the pandemonium that followed, many people were swallowed up by something consisting of Blueschist, and less than half of the population were able to escape. This collapse nearly wiped out the heads of the Amasian government, making subsequent relief efforts and further investigation into the cause of this phenomenon difficult to execute.
