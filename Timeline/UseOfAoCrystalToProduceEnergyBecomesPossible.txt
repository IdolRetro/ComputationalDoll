Use of AO Crystal to produce energy becomes possible

AD: [Manual Entry]

. Drifters often reported seeing Enders in close proximity to AO Crystals, and it was determined that the Enders absorb some kind of energy from the crystals. This discovery launched research projects aiming to harness that energy. A few years later, the technology was created to turn these AO Waves emitted by the crystals into electrical energy. This led to a full- scale operation to harvest as many AO Crystals as possible, as a new source of energy. This in turn had the effect of preventing massive AO Crystals from forming, and of preventing the formation of the Giga Structures that form around them.
