The Drifters are-established

AD: [Manual Entry]

Those exploring the outside world while fending off Enders had become essential for gathering resources and information from their surroundings, and were thus highly valued in several sheltered regions. The people would start calling them "Drifters"a term of respect for these valiant vagabonds willing and able to explore long distances. The first Drifters faced overwhelming danger due to the thin plating and lack of Magus support in their Cradles; the chances of them returning safely were below 70%.
