Exploration of the outside world begins

AD: [Manual Entry]

Even in evacuation zones and places blessed with rainfall, stores of water and food were scarce. Only scant amounts of spring water were drinkable, as consuming the rain itself was totally out of the question. Despite fear of the blue rain, people were compelled to venture into the outside world for sustenance. As far as they could see from indoors, the blue rain that had been lethal to humans seemed to have no effect on the flora and fauna. Without a weather forecast system, groups would manufacture hermetically-sealed wheeled vehicles from the relative safety of the shelters, in the hopes of protecting themselves from the rapidly increasing spells of heavy rainfall.
