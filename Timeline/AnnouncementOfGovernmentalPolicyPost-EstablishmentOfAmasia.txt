Announcement of governmental policy post- establishment of Amasia

AD: [Manual Entry]

Once the Enders dwelling in the vertical shaft were defeated and construction on the Great Shield had started, the governmental policy for the period after establishment of the city was announced. While it expressed hope for the development of the city and humanity, it also announced a strict set of guidelines for becoming a resident, leading a minority of those on the surface who had been friendly toward the project to now turn against it. Certain items were objected to most strongly: Management of the population with birth control and the Terminal Union Obligation to suppress emotions using E-Supplements Division of living area based on profession Most of those who turned against the administration departed the plan and returned to their original settlements, but this also served to intensify the labor movement while radicalizing a small segment of the rebels, turning them into guerillas. This can be considered one of the primary factors in the delay of the construction of Amasia.
