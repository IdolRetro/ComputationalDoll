AD: [Manual Entry]

A thesis predicting the existence in human blood of a substance called Raintight, capable of resisting Blueschist, was published on the Amasia Research Information Network. It was posted by Dothan, who was just 16 at the time. The thesis was quickly and decisively dismissed by the scientific community as delusional nonsense, with Dothan opening himself up to harsh and ongoing criticism.
