Prototype Magus Eyeball

AD: XXXX

An eyeball for Magus use. The entirety of the Magus body is created from materials that fuse the organic and mechanical, and this eyeball is no exception. The part exposed to the outside—that is, the part seen by the contract holder— represents the pinnacle of Amasia biotechnology, creating an eye indistinguishable from that of a human—apart from, perhaps, being even more beautiful. The interior is packed with all forms of sensors, allowing for the transmission of the kind of high-spec calculations unique to Magus. It is fully processed to prevent degradation over time and shows no signs of issues such as corrosion.
