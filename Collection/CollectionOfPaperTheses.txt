Collection of Paper Theses

AD: XXXX

A collection of theses presumed to have been privately printed out onto paper by an Amasian researcher. While paper is a precious resource, its ability to spark inspiration cannot be denied. As such, top-level researchers are given an allotment of a certain number of sheets for the printing of data. All of the theses gathered here were penned by Dothan during his teens, and the title page reads "Collection of Early Theses by Dr. Dothan." It seems he has at least one big fan among the researchers.
