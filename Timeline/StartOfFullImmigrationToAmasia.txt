Start of full immigration to Amasia

AD: [Manual Entry]

With the completion of the Great Shield, a base for Drifters was also established inside the vertical shaft and the surrounding region was quickly stabilized. Dorms for the construction workers were also created inside the shaft and subsequent work proceeded quickly. When around 80% of the construction work on the Amasia residential districts had been completed, immigration to the new city began in earnest.
