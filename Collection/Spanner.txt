Spanner

AD: XXXX

A spanner most likely used by a CRADLECOFFIN mechanic. Below are notes from a mechanic:  "Drifters have said the current CRADLECOFFIN is too slow, so the crew spent a month tuning it up. Well, we made it did make it fast... but to the point where we thought nobody could even pilot it. When we started up the test runs, all of the Drifters were tripping. But after we worked on the Magus support, Drifters became more accustomed to the speed, and now they're all flitting about with ease. I'll miss seeing Drifters fall flat on their face, but if CRADLECOFFINS don't get wrecked from damage from the Enders, that just means less work for us. And less work isn't a bad thing."
