Drifter License

AD: XXXX

A card that provides proof of being a Drifter. Its function is normally served by data carried in a personal terminal, making the issuing of a card such as this one an exception, rather than the norm. The card features the same data as the digital version: the Drifter's name, ID photo, and their combat history. The likelihood of a Drifter surviving for just 1 year during the period this particular license was issued was less than 50%, due to there not yet being any Magus or CRADLECOFFINs. To the citizens of Amasia, living in safety underground, it was almost unthinkable that anyone would sign up for such a job.
