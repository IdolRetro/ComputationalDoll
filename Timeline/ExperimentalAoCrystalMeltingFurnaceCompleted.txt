Experimental AO Crystal melting furnace completed

AD: [Manual Entry]

A joint venture between the surface and former Amasia researchers led to the development of technology that melts fragmented AO Crystals in a high-temperature, high-pressure environment to extract energy. This would allow the use of AO Crystals even without the high-performance Amasian Magus. Even so, the sheer size and intricate structure of the AO Crystal melting furnace meant that it could only be utilized at surface settlement Nests of a certain scale.
