Plant Factory Harvesting Arm

AD: XXXX

This robot arm once harvested vegetables in a fully automated plant factory. Built in the late 21st century, it was one of the valuable sources of electronics necessary in the chaotic period after the Tears of the New Moon. In the times that followed, such relics became tools that humanity used to educate themselves in the science and technology of the past. Such parts include those utilizing advanced technology that cannot be replicated, even at the height of Amasian prosperity in the 23rd century.
