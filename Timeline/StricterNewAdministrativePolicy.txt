Stricter new administrative policy

AD: [Manual Entry]

The use of AO energy now had to be controlled, and the Amasian government announced a new policy to that effect. Occupations providing important services were given energy priority, supplies of materials were curtailed, and harsh population control measures were placed on the residents within Amasia. Many of those pushed too far by these changes abandoned the government's system and set up slums in the lowest level of Amasia. Others chose to return to a life on the surface.
