AO Crystal Sample

AD: XXXX

Small AO Crystals which had already lost their luster and broken into fragments, sealed in photo-cured resin for safekeeping. Hardly any light reaches the AO Crystals within, as a light-absorbing resin was chosen to prevent them from reactivating. Still, several researchers have spoken of this specimen glowing faintly orange in the reference room late at night.
